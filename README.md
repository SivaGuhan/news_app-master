Problem Statement:
There are multiple news sharing apps used by single user and are often spammed by notifications. Also getting brief and customised news of your interest is more difficult. So the main objective is to develop a web portal where people can get to know the latest news around the world.

Installation:
We recommend creating a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app

If you want to start with a TypeScript project you can use the --typescript flag:

npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
# or
yarn create next-app --typescript
# or
pnpm create next-app --typescript

Usage Instructions:
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
